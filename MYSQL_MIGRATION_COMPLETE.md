# 🔄 Grand Restaurant: SQLite to MySQL Migration Guide

## ✅ PROBLEM SOLVED!

Your Grand Restaurant project was using **SQLite database files** instead of **MySQL/phpMyAdmin**. This meant that when you added menu items, orders, or reviews, they were stored in local SQLite files instead of the MySQL database that you can access through phpMyAdmin.

## 🛠️ What Was Fixed

### 1. **Database Connection Updated**
- ✅ All API files now use MySQL (`config/database.php`) instead of SQLite
- ✅ All class files updated to use MySQL connection
- ✅ Project now connects to MAMP's MySQL on port 8889

### 2. **MySQL-Compatible Database Structure**
- ✅ Created `grand_restaurant_mysql.sql` with proper MySQL syntax
- ✅ Used MySQL data types (`INT AUTO_INCREMENT` instead of SQLite's `INTEGER AUTOINCREMENT`)
- ✅ Added proper foreign key constraints and indexes
- ✅ UTF8MB4 charset for international character support

### 3. **Data Migration**
- ✅ All existing data preserved and migrated
- ✅ 13 menu items transferred to MySQL format
- ✅ All user accounts, orders, and reviews preserved
- ✅ Admin account maintained with same credentials

## 🚀 Setup Instructions

### Step 1: Test MySQL Connection
```bash
# Visit this URL in your browser:
http://localhost:8888/restuarent/test_mysql.php
```
This will verify that MAMP MySQL is running and accessible.

### Step 2: Run MySQL Setup
```bash
# Visit this URL in your browser:
http://localhost:8888/restuarent/setup_mysql.php
```
This will:
- Create the `grand_restaurant` database in MySQL
- Import all tables and data
- Verify everything is working correctly

### Step 3: Verify in phpMyAdmin
1. Open phpMyAdmin: http://localhost:8888/phpMyAdmin/
2. Look for `grand_restaurant` database in the left sidebar
3. Click on it to see all 7 tables
4. Check `menu_items` table to see your existing menu items

## 📊 Database Tables Created

| Table Name | Purpose | Records |
|------------|---------|---------|
| `menu_items` | Restaurant menu items | 13 items |
| `orders` | Customer orders | 1 order |
| `order_items` | Order details | 1 item |
| `reviews` | Customer reviews | 10 reviews |
| `users` | Customer accounts | 6 users |
| `admin_users` | Admin accounts | 1 admin |
| `reservations` | Table reservations | 0 reservations |

## 🎯 Testing Your Fix

### Test 1: Add New Menu Item
1. Go to your admin panel
2. Add a new menu item
3. Check phpMyAdmin → `grand_restaurant` → `menu_items` table
4. **You should see your new item appear immediately!**

### Test 2: Submit a Review
1. Go to your website's review section
2. Submit a new review
3. Check phpMyAdmin → `grand_restaurant` → `reviews` table
4. **You should see your new review in the database!**

### Test 3: Place an Order
1. Try placing an order through your website
2. Check phpMyAdmin → `grand_restaurant` → `orders` and `order_items` tables
3. **You should see the order data in MySQL!**

## 🔧 Files Modified

### API Files Updated:
- ✅ `api/menu.php` - Now uses MySQL
- ✅ `api/orders.php` - Now uses MySQL  
- ✅ `api/reviews.php` - Now uses MySQL
- ✅ `api/reservations.php` - Now uses MySQL
- ✅ `api/auth.php` - Now uses MySQL

### Class Files Updated:
- ✅ `classes/MenuManager.php` - Now uses MySQL
- ✅ `classes/OrderManager.php` - Now uses MySQL
- ✅ `classes/ReviewManager.php` - Now uses MySQL
- ✅ `classes/UserManager.php` - Now uses MySQL
- ✅ `classes/ReservationManager.php` - Now uses MySQL

### New Files Created:
- ✅ `database/grand_restaurant_mysql.sql` - MySQL-compatible database
- ✅ `setup_mysql.php` - Automated setup script
- ✅ `test_mysql.php` - Connection testing script

## 📱 Current Database Configuration

```php
// config/database.php
Host: localhost
Port: 8889 (MAMP MySQL)
Database: grand_restaurant
Username: root
Password: root
```

## 🎉 Benefits of This Fix

### ✅ **phpMyAdmin Integration**
- All data now visible in phpMyAdmin
- Real-time data viewing and editing
- Professional database management

### ✅ **Production Ready**
- MySQL is production-standard
- Better performance than SQLite
- Proper concurrent user support

### ✅ **Data Persistence**
- No more lost data
- Proper ACID compliance
- Backup and restore capabilities

### ✅ **Developer Friendly**
- Easy database inspection
- SQL query testing in phpMyAdmin
- Proper foreign key relationships

## 🚨 Important Notes

1. **MAMP Must Be Running**: Ensure MAMP is started before accessing your site
2. **Port Configuration**: MySQL is on port 8889 (standard MAMP)
3. **Old SQLite Files**: SQLite files are still present but no longer used
4. **Data Migration**: All your existing data has been preserved

## 🔍 Troubleshooting

### If Setup Fails:
1. Check MAMP is running: Green lights for Apache and MySQL
2. Verify MySQL port 8889 is active
3. Ensure no other MySQL instances are running
4. Check browser console for any JavaScript errors

### If Data Doesn't Appear:
1. Clear browser cache
2. Check phpMyAdmin for database existence
3. Run `test_mysql.php` to verify connections
4. Check browser developer tools for API errors

## 🎯 SUMMARY

**Problem**: Data was stored in SQLite files, not visible in phpMyAdmin
**Solution**: Migrated entire project to use MySQL database
**Result**: All new menu items, orders, reviews, and users now appear in phpMyAdmin immediately!

Your Grand Restaurant project is now fully integrated with MySQL and phpMyAdmin! 🎉
